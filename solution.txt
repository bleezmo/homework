Within the pop() method, the 'elements[--size]' part will certainly work in returning the last element and shrinking the available stack by one. However, the elements array still contains those objects, even though they are no longer accessible in the Stack. This means you can grow the stack to some large capacity N, then shrink it to size 0, but the N objects will still be in memory and can't be garbage collected. To fix this, you can simply add the line 'elements[size] = null' after the 'Object pop = elements[--size]' line. This will overwrite the pointer and allow the last element to be garbage collected.
